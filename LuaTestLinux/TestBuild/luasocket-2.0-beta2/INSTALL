It should be easy to build LuaSocket. Just as an example, I am providing my
makefiles for Linux, Mac OS X and Visual C.NET. The Linux makefile can be
used for AIX, SunOS, and IRIX too, with little modification.  These build
two shared libraries: one for luasocket and one for mime.

To support dynamic loading of LuaSocket by the stand alone
Lua Interpreter with the use of new "require" and "requirelib" functions,
install the etc/lua.lua file somewhere.

For my Mac OS X box, for instance, I place all files in
/Users/diego/tec/luasocket and set the following environment variables:

    LUA_INIT=@/Users/diego/tec/luasocket/lua.lua
    LUA_PATH=/Users/diego/tec/luasocket/?.lua;?.lua
    LUA_PATHLIB=/Users/diego/tec/luasocket/?.dylib;?.dylib

With that, I can run any luasocket application with the command line:

    lua <script>

as long as the script uses "require" to load the needed namespaces.
Much nicer than having to build a new executable just to initialize
LuaSocket!
