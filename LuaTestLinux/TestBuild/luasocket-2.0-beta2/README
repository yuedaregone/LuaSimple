This release is a "beta" version. It has been tested on WinXP, Mac OS X,
SunOS and Linux. Although no major API changes should happen before the
final version is released, please look for and report any bugs (or
"features") you encounter. 

For this version, all modules should be loaded with the provided "require"
function, and the binaries should be compliled as shared libraries. Check
the makefiles in the distribution and the readme in the 'etc' directory.

Have fun,
Diego Nehab.
