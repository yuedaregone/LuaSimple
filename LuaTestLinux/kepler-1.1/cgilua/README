CGILua 5.1
http://keplerproject.org/cgilua

CGILua is a tool for creating dynamic Web pages and manipulating input
data from Web forms. CGILua allows the separation of logic and data
handling from the generation of pages, making it easy to develop web
applications with Lua.

One of advantages of CGILua is its abstraction of the underlying Web server.
You can develop a CGILua application for one Web server and run it on any
other Web server that supports CGILua, even if using a different launching model.

CGILua can be used with a variety of Web servers and, for each server,
with different launchers. A launcher is responsible for the interaction of
CGILua and the Web server, for example using ISAPI on IIS or mod_lua on Apache.
The reference implementation of CGILua launchers is Kepler.

CGILua is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1. 

Installation
CGILua follows the package model for Lua 5.1, therefore it should be "installed" in your package.path. 

History

* Added fake "package" table to enable the user/programmer to create modules with global visibility
* Bug fix: return of HTTP status code
* Bug fix: close method was recreating the session file

* Fixed a bug with lighttpd

Incompatibility with previous CGILua versions (5.0, 4.0 and 3.x)
* CGILua 5.1 uses Lua 5.1.
* The cgi table is now deprecated. See Receiving parameters for a more detailed explanation.
