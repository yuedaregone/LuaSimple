Xavante 1.3.1
http://keplerproject.org/xavante/

Xavante is a Lua HTTP 1.1 Web server that uses a modular architecture
based on URI mapped handlers. Xavante currently offers a file handler,
a redirect handler and a CGILua handler. Those are used for general files,
URI remapping and CGILua scripts respectively.

Xavante is free software and uses the same license as Lua. 

Xavante dependencies can be separated by the used handlers:

Xavante Core
* Lua 5.1.x
* Copas 1.1.1
* LuaSocket 2.0.1

File Handler (optional)
* LuaFileSystem 1.2.1

CGILua handler (optional)
* CGILua 5.1
* LuaFileSystem 1.2.1
* Rings 1.1.0

The portability of Xavante is determined by its binary components
(LuaSocket, LuaFileSystem and Rings) and Lua itself.
The other components are written in Lua and are as portable as Lua itself.

Xavante follows the package model for Lua 5.1, therefore it should be
"installed" in your package.path.
